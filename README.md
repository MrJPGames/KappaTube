## KappaTube

Twitch on the Nintendo Switch (NRO format).

## Rationale

There is no official twitch client. This works pretty well. But because I used m.twitch.tv instead of the full desktop twitch you cannot log-in and see your following list. Chat is also limited to viewing only, and cannot be viewed while watching a stream (though many streamers include chat as part of their stream anyways). In other words it's very bare-bones but it does allow for easily viewing twitch streams.
